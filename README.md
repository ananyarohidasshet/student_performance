🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Description

The Student Performance Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application developed to predict whether a student is likely to pass or fail based on key academic factors. The system uses historical student data and applies a Logistic Regression model to make predictions. The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow including data collection, preprocessing, model training, prediction, visualization, and deployment.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze student academic performance using machine learning

To predict student pass/fail status

To visualize subject-wise marks using graphs

To provide an interactive web interface for easy use

🧠 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

Type: Supervised Learning (Classification)

Output: Pass (1) or Fail (0)

Logistic Regression is chosen because it is simple, efficient, and suitable for binary classification problems.

📥 Input Features

The model predicts results based on the following inputs:

📘 Study Hours per Day

📊 Attendance Percentage

📝 Internal Marks (Average)

📤 Output

✅ Student is likely to PASS

❌ Student is likely to FAIL

📊 Visualizations

Subject-wise marks displayed using bar charts

Overall performance shown using progress indicators

Helps in identifying strong and weak subjects

🖥️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Web Framework: Streamlit

Libraries:

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Visualization: Streamlit built-in charts

Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud
